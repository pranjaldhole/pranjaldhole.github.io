We use analogies to explain ideas that cannot be shown through a demonstration but can only be experienced at a personal level. Consequently, we often end up mistaking the analogy for the thing itself. Love as an idea is not love. If it is an idea, then it is of thought. Thought, in its essence, is measurement and comparison. Love transpires only through the complete comprehension, not just intellectually, but with the observation of the whole of desire, attachment and pleasure. In this sense, without self-knowledge, without comprehensions of one's desires, there cannot be love.
