I am currently working as a Data Scientist and Scientific Software Developer at the [Image and Data Analysis Facility](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/core-facilities/image-and-data-analysisfacility) at German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Previously I worked as a research staff at [Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg](https://www.h-brs.de/) with [Prof. Dr. Alexander Asteroth](https://www.h-brs.de/de/inf/a.asteroth) in Department of Computer Science
and with [Prof. Dr. Stefanie Meilinger](https://www.h-brs.de/en/prof-dr-stefanie-meilinger) in the [International Center for Sustainable Development](https://www.h-brs.de/en/izne) working on realistic traffic flow modelling.

Before that I worked at [Research Center CAESAR](https://www.caesar.de/) where I worked with Dr. David Greenberg in the [Department of Behaviour and Brain Organization](https://www.caesar.de/en/our-research/current-groups/behavior-and-brain-organization/research-focus.html) primarily working on building mathematical models for pupil-tracking of freely-moving animals. These models help us construct an accurate representation of the external world from animal's eye persective.

Prior to that I studied theoretical physics in the [Gravitation and Relativity group](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gravitation/index.html) with [Prof. Dr. Claus Kiefer](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gravitation/mitarbeiter/kiefer.html) where I investigated emergent paradigms of gravity specifically focussing on the thermodynamic perspective to gravity as one of the viable candidates for the quantum theory of gravity.

My current research spans physics, AI and cognitive science. I focus of building computational models to help us understand the factors affecting driving behaviour of people. I combine my knowledge of complex systems along with optimization algorithms to generate traffic-flows that are as close to reality as possible.

On top of my research I work on a number of side projects that falls under the umbrella term _Artificial Life_. You will find these projects while browsing through the contents of this webpage. 
These pages are intended primarily to organize my research and to provide an overview for those interested in my work.

Thank you for dropping by!
