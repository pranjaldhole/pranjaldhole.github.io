I am currently working as Senior Consultant/Engineer at Capgemini working in the field of Life Sciences. I work as a Data Scientist and consultant to client companies in biomedical and pharmaseutical domain.

Previously I worked as a Data Scientist and Scientific Software Developer at the [Image and Data Analysis Facility](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/core-facilities/image-and-data-analysisfacility) at German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).

Before that I worked as a research staff at [Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg](https://www.h-brs.de/) at the [International Center for Sustainable Development](https://www.h-brs.de/en/izne) working on realistic traffic flow modelling as well as for smart-city infrastructure planning.

Before that I worked at [Research Center CAESAR](https://www.caesar.de/) where I worked with Dr. David Greenberg in the [Department of Behaviour and Brain Organization](https://www.caesar.de/en/our-research/current-groups/behavior-and-brain-organization/research-focus.html) primarily working on building mathematical models for pupil-tracking of freely-moving animals. These models help us construct an accurate representation of the external world from animal's eye persective.

Prior to that I studied theoretical physics in the [Gravitation and Relativity group](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gravitation/index.html) with [Prof. Dr. Claus Kiefer](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gravitation/mitarbeiter/kiefer.html) where I investigated emergent paradigms of gravity specifically focussing on the thermodynamic perspective to gravity as one of the viable candidates for the quantum theory of gravity.

At DZNE, we use state of the art computer vision and machine learning tools to understand the factors leading to neurodegenerative diseases.
Outside DZNE work, part of my research focuses on building computational models to better understand the factors affecting the driving behaviour of people in the road traffic. I combine my knowledge of complex systems along with optimization algorithms to build traffic-flows models that approximate real-world driving behaviour.

In my free time, I construct simulation-based experiments that falls under the umbrella term _Artificial Life_. You will find these projects while browsing through the contents of this webpage.
These pages are intended primarily to organize my research and to provide an overview for those interested in my work.

Thank you for dropping by!
