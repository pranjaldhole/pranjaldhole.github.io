                  When do traffic jams emerge? What are the factors affecting traffic patterns?
                  Modelling realistic road traffic requires detailed understanding of the properties
                  of the traffic flow. In traffic-flow modelling approaches, road traffic is modelled as
                  far-from-equillibrium driven-systems.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  I play around with microscopic traffic flow simulations to gain insight into
                  factors affecting the traffic flow.

                  How does brain process the sensory information? How is the sensory
                  information encoded in the brain? The only way to be certain of how
                  information is stored and retrieved by the brain is to build a mechanical
                  model of the brain. Since that is rather daunting task, field of Artificial
                  Life (AL) emerged. Soft-AL doesn't only concern itself with biological lifeform
                  but uses computer simulations to understand general properties of automata
                  that seem to exhibit life-like properties, e.g.,
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle", target="_blank">
                  Braitenberg vehicles</a> which are reactive agents embedded in a simulated
                  two dimensional environment and reacts to sensory stimuli to produce motor
                  output.

                <p>
                  I am interested in figuring out how to bring about a consistent
                  integration of top-down contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
                  bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
                  in order to meet the challenges introduced by a dynamic environment)
                  for such autonomous agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am also interested in evolutionary studies on population of
                  such autonomous agents.

                  I spend a lot of time thinking about the gravitational
                  interaction and nature of spacetime. During my
                  masters thesis I tried to understand the notion of emergent
                  phenomena in Physics. Since gravitational field equations have
                  same conceptual status as equations of fluid mechanics, how much can
                  we learn about nature of gravitational interaction if it is an
                  emergent phenomena like fluid mechanics?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is the essential role of quantum mechanics in explaining
                  gravitational interaction? Is the world fundamentally quantum
                  mechanical? Is gravity, same as hydrodynamics,
                  manifestly classical? If so, such a quantum theory of gravity
                  is very different from theory of quantized
                  gravity. Is theory of quantized gravity similar
                  to phonon-physics? As phonons won't provide any information about
                  fundamental structure of atoms, would theory of quantized gravity not
                  provide us any information regarding fundamental structure of
                  spacetime? These are few of the questions that keep me
                  up at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think, in order to find a complete theory of quantum gravity, we
                  need to pay attention to three main theoretical constructs, viz.,
                  <table class="time_thesis_table">
    								<tr><td>i. Black-hole singularity</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>ii. Big-bang singularity</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>iii. Cosmological constant problem</td></tr>
                  </table>
                  about which both gravitational and quantum theory has something to say.
                  Any theory of quantum gravity must find a resolution to the
                  aforementioned constructs.
