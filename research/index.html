                One of the important problems in neuroscience is that we don't
                really know what is the true data structure that the brain
                utilizes.The encoding mechanism of the brain through which sensory
                input is mapped to neuronal network remains a mystery to the date.
                The brain needs to create structured
                memory modules in order to utilize it efficiently and produce
                an appropriate response to the sensory stimuli in return.
                <br> Deep learning architectures, inspired by biological neural
                processes, implement algorithms that train the
                network to categorize the data based on labelled/defined features.
                However deep-learning paradigm, so far, do not implement
                structured sets of active neurons.
                This is consequence of enforcing the optimization funtion
                to train the artificial neural network over the data.
                This optimization function,
                in essence, is the constraint that structures the neural
                connectivity.
                I am interested in bringing together concepts from
                Neuroscience, genetics and dynamical systems and implement them in
                deep-learning models.
                <br> We do not yet know which is the optimization function our
                brain implements; but I hope that through the framework of
                computational Neuroethology we
                could get one step closer to understanding encoding and
                decoding mechanisms of the brain.

                In order to analyse how information is stored and retrieved in
                a neuronal network, we need to first construct artificial neural
                network based agents
                (a Breitenberg vehicle embedded in an environment) that are governed
                by self-organization principles.
                I am interested in figuring out how to bring about a consistent
                integration of top-down contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
                bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
                in order to meet the challenges introduced by a changing environment)
                for such autonomous agents.
                <br> I am also interested in evolutionary studies on population of
                such autonomous agents.

                I spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of gravitational
                interaction and nature of spacetime. During my
                masters thesis I tried to understand the notion of emergent
                phenomena in Physics. Since gravitational field equations have
                same conceptual status as equations of fluid mechanics, how much can
                we learn about nature of gravitational interaction if it is an
                emergent phenomena like fluid mechanics?
                <br>What is the essential role of quantum mechanics in explaining
                gravitational interaction? Is the world fundamentally quantum
                mechanical? Is gravity, same as hydrodynamics,
                manifestly classical? If so, such a quantum theory of gravity
                is very different from theory of quantized
                gravity (One can think of theory of quantized gravity would be similar
                to phonon-physics.). These are few of the questions that keep me
                up at night.
                <br>
                I think, in order to find a conmplete theory of quantum gravity, we
                need to pay attention to three main theoretical constructs, viz.,
                <table class="cv_thesis_table">
  								<tr><td>&#9898; Black-hole singularity</td></tr>
                  <tr><td>&#9898; Big-bang singularity</td></tr>
                  <tr><td>&#9898; Cosmological constant problem</td></tr>
                </table>
                about which both gravitational and quantum theory has something to say.
                Any theory of quantum gravity must find a resolution to the
                aforementioned constructs.
