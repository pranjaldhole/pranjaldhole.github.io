      Research Interests:
      <ul>
          <li> Structure of memory:
            <p> I am interested in understanding how our memory is structured
              in the form of neuronal network that enables us to make sense of
              our sensory inputs and prepare an appropriate response in return.
            </p>
            <p> I suspect current deep-learning paradigm might fall short of
              being able to replicate our memory in all its complexity.
              Deep-learning paradigm uses unstructured sets of active neurons that
              represents a very weak data structure. The nature of brute-force
              training through thousands of examples only results in fine-tuned
              connectomes that, perhaps, are weak in feature representation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li> Autonomous agents in embedded systems:
            <p> I am intersted in devising self-organization principles
              for an artificial-neural-network based agent is embedded in an environment.
              I am interested in bringing about a consistent integration of top-down
              contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
              bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
              in order to meet the challenges introduced by a changing environment)
              for an autonomous agents.
            </p>
            <p> I am currently working towards building a simulated system that
              can provide a proof-of-concept of how causation works in a hierarchical
              system. Further details will follow when I make sufficient progress with it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Nature of Gravity:
            <p> I spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of gravitational
              interaction and nature of spacetime. I spent over a year during my
              masters thesis in trying to understand the notion of emergent
              phenomena in Physics. Since gravitational field equations have
              same conceptual status as equations of fluid mechanics, one can
              think of gravity as emergent phenomena like fluid mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
              By taking the thermodynamic limit, one can find a consistent
              of gravity as an emergent phenomena. A quantum theory of gravity
              from such an approach is manifestly different from theory of quantized
              gravity. One can think of theory of quantized gravity would be similar
              to phonon-physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think, in order to find a conmplete theory of quantum gravity, we
              should investigate three main theoretical constructs, viz.,
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Black-hole singularity</li>
                <li> Big-bang singularity</li>
                <li> Cosmological constant problem</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              about which both gravitational and quantum theory has something to say.
              Thus, any theory of quantum gravity must find a resolution to the
              aforementioned constructs.
