      <u>Research Interests</u>:
      <ul>
          <li> <u>Structure of memory</u>:
            <br> I am interested in understanding how our brain maps sensory
              input to a neuronal network. The brain needs to create structured
              memory modules in order to utilize this information and produce
              an appropriate response to the sensory stimuli in return.
            <br> I suspect current deep-learning paradigm might fall short of
              being able to replicate such memory modules in all its complexity.
              Deep-learning paradigm uses unstructured sets of active neurons that
              represent a very weak data structure. The nature of brute-force
              training through thousands of examples only results in fine-tuned
              connectomes that, perhaps, are weak in feature representation. There
              are few methods developed to increase robustness in network predictions
              by random deactivation of neurons while training; however it does
              not get us as far. We need to implement causally top-down approach
              (e.g. feature binding) in order to constrain such networks thereby
              increasing the information content in the system.
            <br>I think making advancements in establishing richer memory modules
              inspired by biological brains would accelerate the field of
              artificial intelligence.

          <br>
          <li> <u>Autonomous agents in embedded systems</u>:
            <br> I am intersted in constructing artificial-neural-network based agents
              (a Breitenberg vehicle embedded in an environment) that are governed
              by self-organization principles.
              It is interesting to figure out how to bring about a consistent
              integration of top-down contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
              bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
              in order to meet the challenges introduced by a changing environment)
              for an autonomous agents.
          </li>

          <li> <u>Nature of Gravity</u>:
            <br> I spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of gravitational
              interaction and nature of spacetime. During my
              masters thesis I tried to understand the notion of emergent
              phenomena in Physics. Since gravitational field equations have
              same conceptual status as equations of fluid mechanics, how much can
              we learn about nature of gravitational interaction if it is an
              emergent phenomena like fluid mechanics?
            <br>What is the essential role of quantum mechanics in explaining
              gravitational interaction? Is the world fundamentally quantum
              mechanical? Is gravity, same as hydrodynamics,
              manifestly classical? If so, such a quantum theory of gravity
              is very different from theory of quantized
              gravity (One can think of theory of quantized gravity would be similar
              to phonon-physics.). These are few of the questions that keep me
              up at night.
            <br>
              I think, in order to find a conmplete theory of quantum gravity, we
              need to pay attention to three main theoretical constructs, viz.,
              <ul>
                <li> Black-hole singularity</li>
                <li> Big-bang singularity</li>
                <li> Cosmological constant problem</li>
              </ul>
              about which both gravitational and quantum theory has something to say.
              Any theory of quantum gravity must find a resolution to the
              aforementioned constructs.
