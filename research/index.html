                  One of the important problems in neuroscience is that we don't
                  really know what is the true data structure that the brain
                  utilizes.The encoding mechanism of the brain through which sensory
                  input is mapped to neuronal network remains a mystery to the date.
                  The brain needs to create structured
                  memory modules in order to utilize the sensory information
                  efficiently and produce
                  an appropriate response in return.
                </p>

                  Deep learning architectures, inspired by biological neural
                  processes, implement algorithms that train the
                  network to categorize the data based on labelled/defined features.
                  However deep-learning paradigm, so far, do not implement
                  structured sets of active neurons.
                  Through the implementation of optimization function,
                  artificial neural network learns an approximate function that
                  minimizes/maximizes the cost given the data.
                  This optimization function,
                  in essence, is the constraint that structures the neural
                  connectivity.
                  I am interested in bringing together concepts from
                  Neuroscience, genetics and dynamical systems and implement them in
                  deep-learning models in order to get insight into the organization
                  of neural connectivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We do not yet know which is the optimization function our
                  brain implements; but I hope that through the framework of
                  embodied autonomous neural systems (see below), we
                  could get one step closer to understanding encoding and
                  decoding mechanisms of the brain.

                  In order to analyse how information is stored and retrieved in
                  a neuronal network, we need to first construct artificial neural
                  network based agents that receives some input and produces output
                  which is based
                  on its neural connectivity. That is, we need to simulate
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle", target="_blank">
                  Braitenberg vehicles</a> embedded in an environment.
                  Such agents are governed
                  by brain-inspired algorithms for self-organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am interested in figuring out how to bring about a consistent
                  integration of top-down contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
                  bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
                  in order to meet the challenges introduced by a dynamic environment)
                  for such autonomous agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am also interested in evolutionary studies on population of
                  such autonomous agents.

                  I spend a lot of time thinking about the gravitational
                  interaction and nature of spacetime. During my
                  masters thesis I tried to understand the notion of emergent
                  phenomena in Physics. Since gravitational field equations have
                  same conceptual status as equations of fluid mechanics, how much can
                  we learn about nature of gravitational interaction if it is an
                  emergent phenomena like fluid mechanics?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is the essential role of quantum mechanics in explaining
                  gravitational interaction? Is the world fundamentally quantum
                  mechanical? Is gravity, same as hydrodynamics,
                  manifestly classical? If so, such a quantum theory of gravity
                  is very different from theory of quantized
                  gravity. Is theory of quantized gravity similar
                  to phonon-physics? As phonons won't provide any information about
                  fundamental structure of atoms, would theory of quantized gravity not
                  provide us any information regarding fundamental structure of
                  spacetime? These are few of the questions that keep me
                  up at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think, in order to find a complete theory of quantum gravity, we
                  need to pay attention to three main theoretical constructs, viz.,
                  <table class="time_thesis_table">
    								<tr><td>i. Black-hole singularity</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>ii. Big-bang singularity</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>iii. Cosmological constant problem</td></tr>
                  </table>
                  about which both gravitational and quantum theory has something to say.
                  Any theory of quantum gravity must find a resolution to the
                  aforementioned constructs.
