              One of the important problems in neuroscience is that we don't
              really know what is the true data structure that the brain
              utilizes.The encoding mechanism of the brain through which sensory
              input is mapped to neuronal network remains a mystery to the date.
              The brain needs to create structured
              memory modules in order to utilize the sensory information
              efficiently and produce
              an appropriate response in return.

              Deep learning architectures, inspired by biological neural
              processes, implement algorithms that train the
              network to categorize the data based on labelled/defined features.
              However deep-learning paradigm, so far, do not implement
              structured sets of active neurons.
              Through the implementation of optimization funtion,
              artificial neural network learns an approximate function that
              minimizes/maximizes the cost given the data.
              This optimization function,
              in essence, is the constraint that structures the neural
              connectivity.
              I am interested in bringing together concepts from
              Neuroscience, genetics and dynamical systems and implement them in
              deep-learning models in order to get insight into the organization
              of neural connectivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not yet know which is the optimization function our
              brain implements; but I hope that through the framework of
              embodied autonomous neural systems (see below), we
              could get one step closer to understanding encoding and
              decoding mechanisms of the brain.

            <p>
              In order to analyse how information is stored and retrieved in
              a neuronal network, we need to first construct artificial neural
              network based agents that receives some input and produces output
              which is based
              on its neural connectivity. That is, we need to simulate
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle", target="_blank">
              Breitenberg vehicles</a> embedded in an environment.
              Such agents are governed
              by brain-inspired algorithms for self-organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am interested in figuring out how to bring about a consistent
              integration of top-down contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
              bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
              in order to meet the challenges introduced by a dynamic environment)
              for such autonomous agents.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also interested in evolutionary studies on population of
              such autonomous agents.

              I spend a lot of time thinking about the gravitational
              interaction and nature of spacetime. During my
              masters thesis I tried to understand the notion of emergent
              phenomena in Physics. Since gravitational field equations have
              same conceptual status as equations of fluid mechanics, how much can
              we learn about nature of gravitational interaction if it is an
              emergent phenomena like fluid mechanics?
            </p>
            <p>
              What is the essential role of quantum mechanics in explaining
              gravitational interaction? Is the world fundamentally quantum
              mechanical? Is gravity, same as hydrodynamics,
              manifestly classical? If so, such a quantum theory of gravity
              is very different from theory of quantized
              gravity. Is theory of quantized gravity similar
              to phonon-physics? As phonons won't provide any information about
              fundamental structure of atoms, would theory of quantized gravity not
              provide us any information regarding fundamental structure of
              spacetime? These are few of the questions that keep me
              up at night.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think, in order to find a complete theory of quantum gravity, we
              need to pay attention to three main theoretical constructs, viz.,
              <table class="cv_thesis_table">
								<tr><td>i. Black-hole singularity</td></tr>
                <tr><td>ii. Big-bang singularity</td></tr>
                <tr><td>iii. Cosmological constant problem</td></tr>
              </table>
              about which both gravitational and quantum theory has something to say.
              Any theory of quantum gravity must find a resolution to the
              aforementioned constructs.
