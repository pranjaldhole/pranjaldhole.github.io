      <u>Research Interests</u>:
      <ul>
          <li> <u>Structure of memory</u>:
            <br> One of the important problems in neuroscience is that we don't
              really know what is the true data structure that the brain
              utilizes.The encoding mechanism of the brain through which sensory
              input is mapped to neuronal network remains a mystery to the date.
              The brain needs to create structured
              memory modules in order to utilize it efficiently and produce
              an appropriate response to the sensory stimuli in return.
            <br> Deep learning architectures, inspired by biological neural
              processes, implement algorithms that train the
              network to categorize the data based on labelled/defined features.
              However deep-learning paradigm, so far, do not implement
              structured sets of active neurons.
              This is consequence of enforcing the optimization funtion
              to train the artificial neural network over the data.
              This optimization function,
              in essence, is the constraint that structures the neural
              connectivity.
              I am interested in bringing together concepts from
              Neuroscience, genetics and dynamical systems and implement them in
              deep-learning models.
            <br> We do not yet know which is the optimization function our
              brain implements; but I hope that through the framework of
              computational Neuroethology we
              could get one step closer to understanding encoding and
              decoding mechanisms of the brain.

          <br>
          <li> <u>Autonomous agents in embedded systems</u>:
            <br> In order to analyse how information is stored and retrieved in
              a neuronal network, we need to first construct artificial neural
              network based agents
              (a Breitenberg vehicle embedded in an environment) that are governed
              by self-organization principles.
              I am interested in figuring out how to bring about a consistent
              integration of top-down contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
              bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
              in order to meet the challenges introduced by a changing environment)
              for such autonomous agents.
            <br> I am also interested in evolutionary studies on population of
              such autonomous agents.

          <li> <u>Nature of Gravity</u>:
            <br> I spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of gravitational
              interaction and nature of spacetime. During my
              masters thesis I tried to understand the notion of emergent
              phenomena in Physics. Since gravitational field equations have
              same conceptual status as equations of fluid mechanics, how much can
              we learn about nature of gravitational interaction if it is an
              emergent phenomena like fluid mechanics?
            <br>What is the essential role of quantum mechanics in explaining
              gravitational interaction? Is the world fundamentally quantum
              mechanical? Is gravity, same as hydrodynamics,
              manifestly classical? If so, such a quantum theory of gravity
              is very different from theory of quantized
              gravity (One can think of theory of quantized gravity would be similar
              to phonon-physics.). These are few of the questions that keep me
              up at night.
            <br>
              I think, in order to find a conmplete theory of quantum gravity, we
              need to pay attention to three main theoretical constructs, viz.,
              <ul>
                <li> Black-hole singularity</li>
                <li> Big-bang singularity</li>
                <li> Cosmological constant problem</li>
              </ul>
              about which both gravitational and quantum theory has something to say.
              Any theory of quantum gravity must find a resolution to the
              aforementioned constructs.
